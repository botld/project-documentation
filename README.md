# project-documentation

The goal of this project is to create a wine centric game launcher loosly based on Lutris.

Ideas:

Git backend

Community install scripts (ala lutris) (Triggers warning)

Officially supported scripts (Does not trigger warning)

Discord support

Feature parity with the (wine-related) customization that lutris provides (libstrangle, gamemode, etc)


Reason:

Strongly disagree with lutris priorities. I believe a project like this should be ran more like the AUR than what it is today and with proper FOSS morals in place.
